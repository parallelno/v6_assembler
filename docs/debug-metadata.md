# Debug Metadata

`v6asm` can emit DWARF v4 source metadata for relocatable ELF objects and for
direct ROM builds through a companion `ET_EXEC` ELF file.

## Generate Debug Output

Pass `-g` (or `--debug`) together with `-f obj`:

```powershell
v6asm -g -f obj game.asm -o game.o
ld.lld -m elf32v6c -T v6c.ld game.o -o game.elf
llvm-objcopy -O binary game.elf game.rom
```

For a direct ROM build, `-g` preserves the ROM bytes and writes a sibling ELF:

```powershell
v6asm -g game.asm -o game.rom
# -> game.rom and game.elf
```

Use `--debug-elf <path>` to choose the companion location. The companion has
an allocatable `.text` section at the ROM's first emitted address, a local
symbol table for module-level code labels, and absolute DWARF line addresses.
Its `.text` contents are the same contiguous byte range as the ROM.

Keep `game.elf` for the debugger and use `game.rom` where a raw ROM image is
required. Do not run a debug-section stripping step on the ELF that the
debugger will consume.

## Emitted ELF Data

With `-g`, the object or ROM companion contains these non-allocating DWARF v4
sections:

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| `.debug_info` | One minimal compilation-unit DIE |
| `.debug_abbrev` | Abbreviations used by that compilation unit |
| `.debug_line` | Instruction source locations plus deterministic directory/file tables |
| `.debug_str` | Compilation-unit strings |

In object mode, `.debug_line` uses `R_V6C_16` relocations against each code
section. Its corresponding `.rela.debug_line` section is present whenever the
input has executable statement rows, and LLD resolves the section-relative
instruction addresses. In a direct-ROM companion, line addresses are already
absolute, so `.rela.debug_line` is omitted.

Inspect an object before linking with:

```powershell
llvm-readelf -S -r game.o
llvm-dwarfdump --debug-info --debug-line game.o
```

Inspect the linked result or direct-ROM companion with the same commands
against `game.elf`.

## Source Attribution

The line table contains statement rows only for instructions. Labels, comments,
control directives, data directives, `.storage`, alignment padding, and `.org`
gaps are not breakpoint targets.

- An ordinary instruction maps to its own source file and line.
- Included files have their own line-table file entries. Paths are normalized
  with `/` separators relative to the source project where possible, so files
  with the same basename remain distinct.
- A loop body creates one instruction row per emitted iteration. These rows
  can share a source line while having different linked addresses. The internal
  row model retains the iteration number as expansion provenance.
- A macro-expanded instruction maps to the macro invocation line. This makes a
  breakpoint on the invocation stop in its generated code rather than on the
  macro definition.
- Multiple instructions separated by `\` on one physical source line produce
  separate rows at their respective instruction starts and physical columns.

The human-readable listing has its own presentation rules. In particular, it
may show macro definition lines while the DWARF line table maps generated
instructions to the invocation site. See [Listing File Format](listing.md) for
listing behavior.

## Symbols

For a debug object, module-level labels are included in `.symtab` as local
symbols unless `.globl`, `.global`, or `.weak` gives them an external binding.
Labels that begin executable instruction ranges use `STT_FUNC`; labels that
begin emitted data or storage ranges use `STT_OBJECT`. Both receive a non-zero
size when the next module label or source range establishes an extent. Existing
section symbols continue to be used for ordinary intra-object relocations.
Direct-ROM companions include the same module-level labels as local symbols.

Scoped `@` labels and macro-generated names are intentionally omitted from the
debugger-facing named-symbol set because their source spelling is not unique.
Use the DWARF line table to locate generated instructions instead.

## Current Limits

- Metadata is DWARF v4 and uses the V6C 16-bit address model.
- The assembler does not parse DWARF. Direct-ROM companions use one contiguous
  `.text` image, so sparse `.org` gaps are represented as zero-filled bytes.
- Link object output with LLD and retain the linked ELF for debugging. For a
  direct ROM build, retain its companion `.elf`; the raw ROM alone has no
  embedded source metadata.
- Debug sections are opt-in. Invocations without `-g` retain the existing
  object and ROM output behavior.
